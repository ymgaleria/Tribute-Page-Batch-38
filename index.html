                Eric Barone (born December 3, 1987), known professionally as ConcernedApe, is an American game designer and musician. 
                He is best known for independently creating the video game Stardew Valley.
                </p>
                <p class="skewed-content tribute-description">
                    Barone was born in Los Angeles and spent his childhood in Auburn, Washington, a suburb in the 
                    Seattle metropolitan area. He cites the Harvest Moon series as his childhood favorite that stayed with him into adulthood.
                    He attended the University of Washington Tacoma and graduated in 2011 with a degree in computer science. Barone had practiced 
                    basic programming but did not consider making video games as a career. Unable to find employment after graduating college, he 
                    initially began developing Stardew Valley in order to practice programming in C#, and planned to put the game on his resume for
                    potential employers. Barone worked on the game daily as its sole creator until its release in 2016. He announced Haunted 
                    Chocolatier in 2021, which has no set release date.

                        Barone began working on Stardew Valley in 2012 and released it in 2016. He was praised for creating the game independently,
                        as its sole designer, programmer, animator, artist, composer, and writer. To complete the game, Barone worked 10 hours a day,
                        seven days a week, for four and a half years. For part of that time, he lived with his parents to save money before moving 
                        out with his girlfriend to Capitol Hill, Seattle. During this time, his girlfriend Amber Hageman worked two jobs to support 
                        the both of them while Barone worked a part-time job as an evening usher at the Paramount Theatre.</p>
                    <p class="sdv-description">
                        Barone initially released Stardew on the PC before later developing it for other consoles. By June 2024, he had sold over 
                        35 million copies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sdv-description clear-margin">
                        In 2017, he was named by Forbes magazine in their list "30 Under 30: Games" for his work on Stardew Valley. Since 2019, 
                        Barone has been assisted on Stardew Valley by another designer and developer team.
